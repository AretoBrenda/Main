//You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 9;
    System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9  
  }
}
